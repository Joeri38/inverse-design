# Inverse Design

Inverse design of a Fabry-Pérot resonator and Bragg reflector

## Fabry-Pérot

The notebook contains the code for the 2 steps of inverse design. This is step 1, the training of a neural network to predict the transmission $T(\lambda)$ of the resonator and step 2, using the network to perform gradient descent on the resonator parameters. The networks we trained are found in the folder "Networks Fabry-Pérot". In the folder "Inverse design Fabry-Pérot/gifs", you can find some interesting gifs of inverse design on transmissions from the test set, like the one below.
